Yalo
====

# Target

Yalo is a Lisp OS running on bare metal x86-64 hardware. The system
programming language is **Ink**, a new Lisp dialect which combines the
elegance of Scheme and powerfulness of Common Lisp. The project webpage
is: <https://github.com/whily/yalo>

# Status

The project is only at very very initial stage, with an
[assembler](https://github.com/whily/yalo/blob/master/doc/AssemblyX64.md)
written in Common Lisp, and a 64 bit bootloader.

"Short term" plan:

- [x] VGA text mode without using BIOS.
- [x] Keyboard handling without using BIOS.
- [x] Switch to 32 bit protected mode.
- [x] Switch to 64 bit long mode.
- [ ] Physical/virtual memory management.
- [ ] Userland and system call.
- [ ] Implement Ink interpreter with assembly.
- [ ] Self hosting a more powerful Ink interpreter with Ink itself.

# Getting Started

## Getting Bootable Image

Currently, cross compilation is needed to build one floppy image
containing yalo.

### [Cross compilation](https://github.com/whily/yalo/blob/master/doc/CrossCompilation.md)

Although yalo should compile on any Ansi Common Lisp implementation,
it is only tested on SBCL. Therefore the following discussion is
focused on how to build yalo from SBCL.

Mandatory Requirements:
* [SBCL](http://sbcl.sourceforge.net SBCL)
* git

Optional Requirements:
* Emacs
* SLIME

#### Getting Source Code

Run following command to anonymously checkout the latest source code
of yalo.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/whily/yalo.git
```

#### Setup link for ASDF

Run following commands to make SBCL aware of the ASDF file for the
cross compiler.

```shell
$ cd yalo/cc
$ ./lnasdf
```

#### Build Floppy Image

##### With SBCL alone

When using SBCL alone, type the following at REPL:

```lisp
* (require 'asdf)
* (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'cc)
* (in-package :cc)
* (write-kernel "floppy.img")
```

One may type `Ctrl-d` to exit from SBCL.

##### With Emacs+SLIME

Inside Emacs,

1. First type `M-x slime` if SLIME is not started.
2. Type `M-x slime-load-system` then type `cc` when prompted for the
   system.
3. At REPL, type `(in-package :cc)` to switch to package *cc*
   (alternatively, one can user keyboard shortcut `C-x M-p` and then type `cc`).
4. Type `(write-kernel "../floppy.img")` at SLIME REPL to generate the kernel.
   Here we assume that current directory is `cc` of the source tree, therefore
   `floppy.img` is written directly to the source tree, where scripts to run the
   image (e.g. `run-bochs`) are located.

## Run Image

There are various ways to run the image.

### Bochs

Go to the root directory of the source code, where script `run-bochs`
and `debug-bochs` are located. Run the scripts and select *6* to
proceed emulation. The difference between `run-bochs` and
`debug-bochs` is that after selecting *6*, emulation starts directly
for `run-bochs`; while for `debug-bochs`, emulator pauses before BIOS,
and one needs to type `c` in the debugger window to continue the
emulation.

### QEMU

Similar to Bochs, go to the root directory of the source code, where
script `run-qemu` and `debug-qemu` are located.

In both `run-qemu` and `debug-qemu`, QEMU monitor is redirectted to
stdio (via argument `-monitor stdio`). Script `run-qemu` will start
the emulator without GDB support; while `debug-qemu` enables GDB
support: `-s` argument makes QEMU listens to port 1234 for GDB, while
`-S` argument makes QEMU pauses at the beginning for GDB's `continue`
command. After running `debug-qemu` and starting GDB, first type
`target remote :1234` to connect to QEMU, then type command `continue`
to resume the emulation.

### VirtualBox

In the **Storage** page of the virtual machine settings, right click
and select "Add Floppy Controller". And the select the image file
`floppy.img` for floppy drive. In the **System** page of virtual
machine settings, make sure that Floppy is checked for Boot order.

Go to the root directory of the source
code, where script `run-virtualbox` and `debug-virtualbox` are
located. Run script `run-virtualbox` to start the emulator, or script
`debug-virtualbox` to start the emulator with debug window.
