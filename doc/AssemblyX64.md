Assembly syntax used by CL cross compiler and Ink
=================================================

# Introduction

Lisp Assembly Program (LAP) uses list structure to contain assembly
code. Basically, atoms represent labels while lists represent (pseudo)
instructions. Local labels (starting with a period) are also supported.

Lisp expressions can be used for immediate values. In addition, since
LAP is an S-expression, macros could be used to mimic the macro
facility of *real* assemblers.

The syntax is similar to what NASM uses. Basically, Intel syntax is
used, i.e. destination operand precedes source operand.

To get a feeling about what LAP looks like, one may take a look at the
value of `*bootloader*` defined in https://github.com/whily/yalo/blob/master/cc/bootloader.lisp.

# Pseudo Instructions of Assembly.

Directives (e.g. bits, origin) are categorized as pseudo instructions
here too.

## addressing: addressing mode

Set the default setting of whether RIP Relative Addressing is used in
64 bit mode. This only applies when memory label is used (i.e. it does
not affect the addressing options when registers are used, also it is
not applicable to absolute address like #xb8000). One can use
per-instruction override of `abs` or `rel` explicitly, for example:
`(mov byte (abs msg) 0)`.

| Instruction    | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| addressing abs | Default to bsolute addresing                |
| addressing rel | Default to RIP Relative addresing (default) |

## align: boundary align

The next instruction will be aligned at the boundary specified. NOP
(#x90) will be inserted if necessary.

| Instruction                | Description   |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| align 4 &#124; 8 &#124; 16 |               |

## bits: Bit Mode

| Instruction | Description           |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| bits 16     | 16-bit mode           |
| bits 64     | 64-bit mode (default) |

## db: Declaring initialized byte value(s)

| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| db (_number_ &#124; _string_)* | Declare byte values via lists |

Note:

* _number_ should be in range -128..+255. Expression within the same
range can be used as well.

| dd (_number_)*         | Declare doubleword value via lists   |

Note:

* _number_ should be in range -2,147,483,648..+4,294,967,295.
Expression within the same range can be used as well.

## dq: Declaring initialized quadword value(s)

| Instruction            | Description                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| dq (_number_)*         | Declare quadword value via lists   |

Note:

* _number_ should be in range
-9,223,372,036,854,775,808..+18,446,744,073,709,551,615.
Expression within the same range can be used as well.

## equ: Define Constant

| Instruction        | Description                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |

Note:

* _expr_ should be evaulated when encoutering the instruction,
i.e. forward reference is not allowed.

## org: Define Origin

| Instruction | Description             |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| org val     | Define origin to be val |

Note:

* *org* can be used multiple times, however $$ refers to the latest definition of *org*.

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| times _count_ _instruction_ | Assemble _count_ times of _instruction_ |

Note:

* _count_ could be an expression which can be evaluated when *times*
instruction is encoutered, e.g. containing $, $$, or labels defined
before *times* instruction.
* _instruction_ can be any other (pseudo) instructions.

# Special Variables of Assembly.

Following special variables are supported:
* **$** Location of the start of current instruction.
* **$$** Origin (start address) of current assembly program.

# Overview of x86-64 Assembly

## Intruction

This wiki lists the machine instructions supported by x86-64 LAP, and
the short description of the functions for each instruction. One
should refer to Intel or AMD manuals for complete reference.

For each mnemonic, one table is provided to list the supported
instructions. There are 2 columns in the table:
* **Instruction**: documents mnemonic and operands.
* **Opcode**: documents the translated opcode.

## Notations for Instructions

Following notations are used:
* **imm8**: immediate byte value in the range of -128..+255.
* **imm16**: immediate word value in the range of -32,768..+65,535.
* **imm32**: immediate doubleword value in the range of -2,147,483,648..+4,294,967,295.
* **imm64**: immediate quadword value in the range of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808..+18,446,744,073,709,551,615..
* **r8**: one of the byte general-purpose registers: al, cl, dl, bl, ah, ch, dh, bh, bpl, spl, dil, and sil.
* **r16**: one of the word general-purpose registers: ax, cx, dx, bx, sp, bp, si, di.
* **r32**: one of the doubleword general-purpose registers: eax, ecx, edx, ebx, esp, ebp, esi, edi.
* **r64**: one of the quadword general-purpose registers: rax, rcx, rdx, rbx, rsp, rbp, rsi, rdi, r8-r15.
* **m8, m16, m32, m64, m128**: memory references. Specifier (`byte`, `word`, `dword`, `qword`) is needed for ambiguous cases. For example in  `(mov word (12345) 16).
* **m16&32**, **m16&16**, **m32&32**, **m16&64**, a memory operand containing one pair whose sizes are indicated on the left and right size of the ampersand.
* **r/m8, r/m16, r/m32, r/m64**: register or memeory choices. For example, r/m8 means that either r8 or m8 can be used as operand.
* **sreg**: segment register.

## Range of Immediate Values

Note that the range for imm8/16/32/64 is defined considering the
capcity of 8/16/32/64 bits. The range might be too broad for jmp like
instructions which require *true* signed integers, however the impact
is minimal.

In 64 bit mode, the default operand size is 32 bit. REX.W is used for
64 bit operand size. When 32 bit register is used as target, the
result is automatically sign extended to 64 bit. To reduce the
generated machine code size, the assembler automatically use the 32
bit operand size if immediate value can be represented as 32 bits. For
example, `(mov eax 1)` and `(mov rax 1)` generates same machine
code. Note that such optimization is mainly meaningful for *mov*
instructions, as sign extension to 64 bit is generally not applicable
for other instructions unless the upper 32 bits are always 0.

## Memory Address Operands

Memory address operands are supported, e.g. `(bp)`, `(var)`, `(bp si
5)`. Note that the order is flexible. For example, `(bp si 3)` is
equivalent to `(si 3 bp)`.

For scaled index of 32-bit addressing modes, one has to use the form
of register*scale, e.g. eax*8.

Segment override prefix is used purely as a prefix, e.g. `(es mov al
(di))`, which is different from traditional syntax. The motiviation is
to use a simple method to handle this case as such override is not
used in 64 bit mode.

## Notations for Opcodes

Following notations are used:
* A hex number, such as CC, indicates a fixed byte containing that number.
* A hex number followed by **+r**, like **B0+r**, indicates that one of the operands is a register, and correspondign register value should be added to the opcode.
* **/n** (where n is 0 to 7): indictes that one of the operand is r/m, and the field Reg/Opcode should be encoded with n.
* **/r**: ModR/M byte of the instruction contains a register operand (encoded in field Reg/Opcode) and an r/m operand (encoded in field R/M).
* **cb, cw, cd, co**: one of the operands is an immediate value, and the _difference_ between this value and the end address of the instruction is to be encoded as byte (cb), little-endian word (cw), little-endian doubleword (cd), and little-endian quadword (co) respectively.
* **ib, iw, id, io**: one of the operands is an immediate value, and it is to be encoded as byte (ib), little-endian word (iw), little-endian doubleword (id), and little-endian quadword (io) respectively.
* **o16, o32**: operand-size override prefix. o16 generates no code in 16-bit mode, but indicates a 66h prefix in 32/64-bit mode; similarly, o32 generates no code in 32/64-bit mode, but indicates a 66h prefix in 16-bit mode.
* **a16, a32**: address-size override prefix. a16 generates no code in 16-bit mode, but indicates a 67h prefix in 32/64-bit mode; similarly, a32 generates no code in 32-bit mode, but indicates a 67h prefix in 16/64-bit mode.
* **rex.w**: REX prefix indicating 64 bit operand, in 64 bit mode.

Note that REX prefix are not used in opcode notations. The prefix is
automatically generated by analyzing the operands.

### Conditional Codes

Conditional codes are used for Jcc, CMOVcc, and SETcc instructions, which are
encoded as (+ xx cc). Meaning of conditional codes are listed below.
